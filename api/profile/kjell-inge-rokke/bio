    "Kjell Inge Rokke owns over 68% of publicly traded Aker, a shipping and offshore drilling conglomerate.",
    "He got his start selling fish off a boat in Seattle before returning to Norway where he built a fleet and a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider.",
    "In 2016 Aker decreased its ties to the industry that made Rokke rich, selling a stake in fishing firm Havfisk to Leroy Seafood Group for $250 million",
    "Rokke commissioned a nearly-600-foot yacht in 2017 that will spend part of its time on environmental research missions in partnership with WWF Norway.",
    "The superyacht, which will be able to accommodate up to 60 scientists and 30 crew during research expeditions, is expected to be completed in 2025, five years behind schedule."
