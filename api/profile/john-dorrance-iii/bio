    "John Dorrance is an heir to the Campbell's Soup fortune; his grandfather invented Campbell's formula for condensed soup.",
    "His relatives are still the company's largest shareholders, but he sold his stake in the mid-1990's and emigrated to Ireland.",
    "His move was presumably timed to avoid capital gains taxes when he sold his Campbell's stake.",
    "The Irish government reportedly gave Dorrance citizenship in 1995 when he spent $1.5 million planting trees."
