  "He left to design clothes for Nino Cerruti and eventually launched his own line in the mid-1970s with the help of his partner, Sergio Galeotti.",
  "His business surged after he was asked to design actor Richard Gere's wardrobe for the 1980 blockbuster film American Gigolo.",
  "Since then he has expanded into accessories, perfumes, makeup and sportswear -- plus interior design, real estate, restaurants and hotels."
