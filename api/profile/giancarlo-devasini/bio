    "Giancarlo Devasini is the chief financial officer, and likely the biggest shareholder, of Tether, the largest issuer of crypto stablecoins.",
    "More than 100 billion Tether tokens have been minted. Buoyed by higher interest rates, Tether generated $6.2 billion in profit in 2023 from the interest it generates on customers' collateral.",
    "Devasini owns an estimated 47% stake in Tether, which Forbes values by applying the average price-to-earnings multiples of a group of publicly traded mid-tier banks and asset managers."
