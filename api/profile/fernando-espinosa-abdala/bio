    "Fernando Espinosa Abdal√° and his brother Leopoldo derive much of their fortune from the sale of their drug manufacturer Rimsa, which it sold to Tel Aviv-based Teva Pharmaceuticals for $2.3 billion.",
    "Fernando was the operational president of the company before the sale in 2016.",
    "Their father founded the business in 1970 as a pharmaceutical distributor before expanding into manufacturing.",
    "Following the sale, Teva sued Fernando and Leopoldo claiming fraud and a breach of contract.",
    "Most of the charges were dismissed; as for breach of contract, the parties eventually settled for less than $200 million."
