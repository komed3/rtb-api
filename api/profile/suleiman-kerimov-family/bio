    "A native of Dagestan, Kerimov represents the republic in Russia's Federation Council since 2008. He was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018 together with seven other billionaires close to Russian authorities. The EU and UK sanctioned him in March 2022.",
    "A trained economist, Kerimov made a career investing in distressed assets in Russia. He also made money on Sberbank and Gazprom shares.",
    "He cashed out and heavily invested in global banks such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank right before the 2008 financial meltdown. He got margin calls and lost billions.",
    "Kerimov recovered by betting on Polyus, Russia's biggest gold producer, which he bought from billionaire Vladimir Potanin. He paid $1.3b for 37% shares that time.",
    "In 2015 to get around a law, barring politicians from holding financial assets abroad, he gave shares in Polyus to his son Said. In the beginning of 2022 Kerimov's family owned 76% of Polyus.",
    "Said Kerimov was sanctioned by EU and UK in April 2022. He transferred his stake in Polyus to father's former colleague in Federation Council Akhmet Palankoev and to the Islamic Organisations Support Foundation."
