    "Shigenobu Nagamori is the founder and chairman of motor manufacturer Nidec.",
    "Nidec bills itself as the world's largest manufacturer of motors for hard-disk drives and optical drives, by units sold.",
    "Nagamori has said publicly that his goal is to hit ¥10 trillion ($91 billion) in revenue by 2030, partly by focusing on drivetrains for electric vehicles.",
    "In 2024, Mitsuya Kishida, one of five executive vice presidents, became the new president and CEO.",
    "Nidec was removed from Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes in November. The exchange marks it a \"security on special alert\" due partly to lax internal controls and an ongoing investigation over accounting scandal at one of its subsidiaries."
