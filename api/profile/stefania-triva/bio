    "Stefania Triva is CEO and the largest shareholder of Italy-based Copan, one of the world's largest producers of flocked swabs for diagnostic tests.",
    "Founded in 1979 by her father, Giorgio, Copan initially distributed lab products and started to make swabs in 1982, when her brother Daniele joined the firm.",
    "Daniele succeeded Giorgio after his death in 2002; in 2003, he invented flocked swabs, which collect more sample material than regular cotton Q-tips.",
    "Stefania took over as CEO after Daniele's death in 2014; the Covid-19 pandemic led to a dramatic surge in demand for Copan's products.",
    "Flocked swabs made up more than 80% of Copan's $445 million revenues in 2021; the firm also makes machines and software that automate diagnostics."
