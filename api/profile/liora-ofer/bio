    "The company's largest asset is a controlling stake in publicly traded real estate firm Melisron.",
    "In 2015, Liora won a years-long court battle with her brother Doron Ofer over their inheritance, which left her with nearly 52% of Ofer Investments.",
    "Liora now owns 100% of the investment company after a conflict-of-interest law forced her cousin, Eyal, to divest, and she bought the remaining 15% from her brother in January 2023.",
    "She and Eyal swapped assets, with Liora giving up her stake in Mizrahi Tefahot Bank in exchange for a greater share of Ofer."
