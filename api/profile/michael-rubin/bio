    "Michael Rubin is the founder and CEO of Fanatics, the online sports merchandising retailer that also offers trading cards, autographed collectibles, live events and sports betting.",
    "After dropping out of Villanova University, Rubin started GSI Commerce, which he sold to eBay for $2.4 billion in 2011.",
    "As part of the deal, he paid $500 million for majority ownership of three assets eBay didn't want: Fanatics, Rue La La and ShopRunner.",
    "In 2018, flash-sales site Rue La La acquired rival Gilt Groupe. A year later, mall operator Simon Property Group took a 50% stake in the combined company.",
    "Rubin sold ShopRunner to FedEx for an undisclosed amount in 2020. He still owns minority stakes in Fanatics and Rue Gilt Group.",
    "He owned 10% of the parent company of the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils, but he divested in 2022 primarily to avoid conflicts with Fanatics' sports betting business and player partnerships."
