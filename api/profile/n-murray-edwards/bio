  "N. Murray Edwards derives much of his fortune from stakes in Canadian oil and mining companies.",
  "His largest investments include oil sands miner Canadian Natural Resources, aerospace firm Magellan and a minority stake in the NHL's Calgary Flames.",
  "A lawyer by training, Edwards made the jump to business at age 28 after promising a dying friend that he would always pursue his passions.",
  "He started a merchant bank with partners in the late 1980's, but they spent half their initial capital on digging a natural gas well that came up dry.",
