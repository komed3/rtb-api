    "Lin Muqin is the chairman and CEO of Shanghai-listed energy drinks maker Eastroc Beverage.",
    "The mogul started out as a technician at a state-owned construction firm, and later found a job at a Shenzhen-based beverage company.",
    "In 1997 he joined Eastroc, then a state-run beverage business, as its vice president. Lin reportedly scraped together more than 4 million yuan ($570,000) to acquire that firm in early 2000s.",
    "The mogul soon focused on making energy drinks. He managed to build Eastroc into China's second largest energy drinks maker by sales partly through offering products at cheaper prices.",
    "In recent years Eastroc has been diversifying into other market segments including coffee and tea-based beverages."
