  "Erwin Franz Mueller owns an eponymous drugstore chain with some 880 stores across seven European countries and annual revenue of around $4.8 billion.",
  "The business dates to 1953, when Mueller opened a hairdressing shop in his home in Ulm, Germany.",
  "In recent years, working conditions at his drugstores have been the subject of scrutiny in media reports.",
  " In 2016, German authorities stopped court proceedings against Mueller involving him having concealed assets in Swiss private bank J. Safra Sarasin.",
  "Mueller sued the bank, and in 2017 a German court ruled that the bank had to pay him $50 million in compensation for incorrect investment advice."
