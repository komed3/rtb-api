    "William Goldring's Sazerac Company owns some 500 alcohol brands and a dozen distilleries in the U.S., Canada, France, Ireland and India.",
    "The $3 billion (est. sales) business produces storied spirits such Pappy Van Winkle and George T. Stagg, but has ballooned in size thanks to lower-shelf offerings like Fireball Cinnamon Whisky.",
    "Goldring took over the alcohol business built up by his father, Stephen Goldring (d. 1996), in the 1960s.",
    "He grew the family's wholesaling operations, selling their stake in 2010 for an estimated $400 million, and bought up spirits brands such as Southern Comfort, Goldschlager and Myers's Rum."
