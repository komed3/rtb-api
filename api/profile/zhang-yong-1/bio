    "Haidilao has nearly 1,400 restaurants in Greater China. It is renowned for its spicy dishes and attentive customer service, including free manicures for waiting customers.",
    "It spun off its overseas business Super Hi, which went public in Hong Kong in 2022 and had a dual listing on Nasdaq in 2024. Super Hi has over 100 restaurants in international markets.",
    "Having never finished high school, the entrepreneur says he didn't even know how to prepare the typical Sichuan hotpot when he started.",
    "Three friends, including Shu Ping who became his wife, helped with seed money, but he ran the place. In 2022, he stepped down as CEO to focus on long-term strategies."

  "about": [
    "Haidilao means deep-sea fishing, or literally \"scooping the bottom of the ocean.\"",
    "Zhang often spent the night in his first restaurant on a foldaway bed. His worst memory was breaking a $100 aquarium he had saved up for to display fresh seafood."
