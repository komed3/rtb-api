    "Mark Davis owns the Las Vegas Raiders, the NFL team he inherited from his father, Al Davis (d. 2011).",
    "Davis' only jobs have ever been with the team. He worked first in the equipment room, then in team retail, where he is said to have invented the muff-style hand warmer that is now used league-wide.",
    "Davis moved the Raiders from Oakland to Las Vegas in 2020 after a failed attempt to relocate to Los Angeles.",
    "When Davis took over, Forbes valued the team at $761 million. Now, it's worth $6.2 billion."
