  "Marina Prada and her siblings, Miuccia and Alberto, inherited a share of Prada, the handbag and fashion empire founded by their grandfather in 1913.",
  "A year after the siblings inherited their stakes in Prada, Miuccia married Patrizio Bertelli; the duo now oversee Prada together as co-CEOs.",
  "Marina and Alberto are not involved in running the business but each hold an estimated 12% stake in Prada."
