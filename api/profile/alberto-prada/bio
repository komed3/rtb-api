    "Alberto Prada and his sisters, Miuccia and Marina, inherited a share of Prada, the handbag and fashion empire founded by their grandfather in 1913.",
    "A year after the siblings inherited their stakes in Prada, Miuccia married Patrizio Bertelli; the duo now oversee Prada together as co-CEOs.",
    "Neither Marina or Alberto are involved in running the business but own an estimated 12% stake in the company."
