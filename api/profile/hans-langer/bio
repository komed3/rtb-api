  "Hans Langer is the world's first 3-D printing billionaire.",
  "Langer founded EOS, one of the earliest and most successful 3-D printing companies, more than 30 years ago.",
  "Daughter Marie Langer took over as CEO of the largest operating business, EOS GmbH, which makes 3D printers for polymers and metals, in October 2019.",
  "While others focused on consumers and 3-D printing, Langer always believed that the technology's true value was in industrial applications.",
  "Venture capital firms have plowed funds into American 3D printing startups, but the Langer family has turned down investments and sales offers."
