    "One of the highest paid actors in Hollywood history, Arnold Schwarzenegger has earned some $500 million (before taxes and fees) in paychecks and profit-sharing deals from his movies.",
    "He's made even more from early bets on everything from California real estate to stakes in some of the world's most valuable brands.",
    "Perhaps his smartest bet was buying a minority stake in $718 billion (assets) Dimensional Fund Advisors, founded by fellow billionaire David Booth, in 1996, when it was managing $12 billion in assets.",
    "Schwarzenegger initially bought just under 5% of the firm's equity for an undisclosed sum; the initial stake is now worth nearly $500 million.",

    "Today, Schwarzenegger continues to own several businesses: film and production company Oak Productions, Fitness Publications Inc and film and trademarking holding venture Pumping Iron America."
