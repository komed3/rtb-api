    "Cliff Obrecht is cofounder and chief operating officer of design software maker Canva, which was valued in August 2025 at $42 billion, higher than its previous peak valuation of $40 billion in September 2021.",
    "Canva was launched in 2013 by Obrecht, now-wife Melanie Perkins and Cameron Adams in Sydney, Australia, but was met by investor skepticism due to its location.",
    "Like Perkins, he owns an estimated 18% stake. The couple has pledged to transfer more than 80% of their stake to the Canva Foundation for charitable causes.",
    "Defying the doubts, Canva has attracted 240 million monthly users to its freemium software, with 6 million teams from companies like Zoom paying for it.",
    "Canva's software enables the creation of attractive visuals for menus, resumes and Instagram graphics."
