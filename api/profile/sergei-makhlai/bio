  "Sergei Makhlai is co-owner of Togliattiazot, one of Russia's biggest producers of nitrogen fertilizers.",
  "In 2011 he became the head of Togliattiazot after his father, Vladimir Makhlai, stepped down as the company's CEO.",
  "In May 2019, the Russian government opened an investigation against him and his father for large-scale fraud. In July that year, they were each sentenced in absentia to nine years in prison.",
  "The Makhlais, who deny wrongdoing, do not live in Russia and have thus not served any time."
