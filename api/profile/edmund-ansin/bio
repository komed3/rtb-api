    "Edmund Ansin inherited a real estate fortune and has added television stations to his portfolio.",
    "In 1962 he and his father, Sidney, paid $3.4 million for Miami's WSVN, where he pioneered the \"if it bleeds, it leads\" style of TV journalism.",
    "He took that approach to his native Boston market, where he operated NBC and CW affiliate stations.",
    "In 2016 NBC announced that it would end the 22-year affiliation with Ansins' WHDH TV in Boston in favor of its own channel, which started in 2017.",
    "Ansin sued NBC parent Comcast, alleging a violation of contract and anti-trust laws, but a federal court dismissed the suit."
