    "Jackson is the granddaughter of Robert Irsay, who acquired the Indianapolis Colts in 1972, and the youngest daughter of Jim Irsay, who ran the team from 1997 until his death in May 2025.",
    "She and her sisters, Carlie Irsay-Gordon and Casey Foyt, inherited what Forbes estimates are equal 33.3% stakes in the franchise. They now rank among the richest female owners in sports.",
    "Long before the three sisters were publicly named Colts co-owners in 2012, they had spent countless years around the organization, with their lives always revolving around the NFL schedule. Jackson, her sisters and their father all had matching horseshoe tattoos.",
    "\"He let us in on conversations at a very young age, and when I look back on it now, I'm kind of surprised,\" Jackson said of Irsay in June 2025. \"But he trusted us, and he knew that we understood the seriousness of this job and the responsibility that we had. And I think we'll forever be grateful.\"",
    "Jackson officially joined the organization in 2010 and currently leads its philanthropic arm, including mental health nonprofit Kicking The Stigma, while also holding the title of chief brand officer."
