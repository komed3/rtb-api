    "Richard Liu, who also goes by his Chinese name Liu Qiangdong, is the founder and chairman of e-commerce site JD.com.",
    "He stepped down as JD.com chief executive in 2022, joining other tycoons in relinquishing top management roles as Beijing seeks to rein in the market influence of large tech firms.",
    "Liu started his career by opening a retail shop to sell electronic gadgets in 1998. He closed it six years later and moved the business online.",
    "He also chairs two of JD.com's Hong Kong-listed units, JD Health and JD Logistics.",
    "In 2024, Walmart sold its entire 9.4% stake in JD.com for $3.6 billion, ending an eight-year partnership as the U.S. retail giant shifts to focus on its own operation in China."
