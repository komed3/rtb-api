    "An heir to a Belgian sugar fortune, Eric Wittouck is a descendant of the family that founded Tiense Suicker.",
    "Wittouck's net worth has expanded dramatically thanks to Invus, a New York private equity firm that mostly manages Wittouck's money.",
    "Run by Ray Debbane, Invus has scored huge returns through investments like Blue Buffalo Pet Products and Weight Watchers.",
    "Wittouck's decision to remain fully invested in Invus is one of the greatest investment decisions ever. His cousins mostly pulled their cash out 20 years ago."
