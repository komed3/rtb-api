    "Irsay-Gordon is the granddaughter of Robert Irsay, who acquired the Indianapolis Colts in 1972, and the eldest daughter of Jim Irsay, who ran the team from 1997 until his death in May 2025.",
    "She and her sisters, Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson, inherited what Forbes estimates are equal 33.3% stakes in the franchise. They now rank among the richest female owners in sports.",
    "Irsay-Gordon serves as the Colts' principal owner and CEO. Long seen as her father's likeliest successor, she got early experience leading the franchise when she stepped in for Irsay in 2014 after his legal troubles resulted in a six-game suspension.",
    "Irsay-Gordon once served as a team intern and has been involved with the organization's inner workings for more than two decades, having represented the franchise at NFL owners' meetings as early as 2004. Four years later, she took on a vice president role.",
    "She has demonstrated a hands-on approach, attending meetings with players and coaches and standing on the sideline during games listening to play calls over a headset."
