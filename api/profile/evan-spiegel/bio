  "Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, is one of only three self-made billionaires in the world under the age of 30.",
  "Each day some 203 million people use Snapchat to send disappearing photos and videos; the app faces growing competition from Facebook-owned Instagram.",
  "Spiegel cofounded the company with Bobby Murphy, a Stanford University fraternity brother, in 2011.",
  "Spiegel and Murphy each own about 18% of Snap but have voting shares that give them control over the board.",
  "Spiegel graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Product Design in 2018, six years after he first dropped out to start Snapchat.",
  "Spiegel has donated nearly $65 million in Snap stock. He and Murphy have pledged to donate 13 million shares to the Snap Foundation."
