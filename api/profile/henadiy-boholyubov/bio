    "With fellow Ukrainian billionaire Ihor Kolomoyskyy, Henadiy Boholyubov founded PrivatBank with $1 million in capital in the early 1990s.",
    "Over the years it grew to be a key bank in Ukraine, handling more than a third of private deposits and serving about half the country's population.",
    "In 2016, Ukraine's government nationalized the bank; an investigation indicated large-scale fraud over a period of ten years.",
    "Last December, a London High Court ordered a freeze on some $2.5 billion worth of assets held by Boholyubov and Kolomoyskyy. They deny the charges.",
    "The two men settled a lawsuit in 2016 with billionaire Viktor Pinchuk, who had sued them for damages for unfulfilled pledges on mining investments."
