    "Cristina Green and her husband Philip Green own the embattled retail empire Arcadia Group, which fell into bankruptcy during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "The business was subsequently forced to sell its best-known brands, including Topshop, Top Man and Dorothy Perkins.",
    "Outside of Arcadia, the Greens own three yachts worth about $140 million and nearly $40 million of real estate that Cristina was found to have bought through offshore firms.",
    "The Greens have been vilified in Britain for their role in letting home retailer BHS collapse, which put pensions for 19,000 workers at risk in 2016."
