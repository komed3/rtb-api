  "bio": [
    "Pollyanna Chu was Hong Kong's wealthiest woman in 2017 based mainly on her stake in Kingston Financial Group, which she cofounded in the early 1990s.",
    "She has tapped her personal network, the city's proximity to China and a more liberal stock market regime to build Kingston into a financial powerhouse.",
    "She chose to bet on the region's growing capital markets, instead of stepping into her family's hotel and casino business.",
    "In 2018, Chu led a consortium of investors who paid $5.2 billion for the Center in Hong Kong, making it the world's most expensive skyscraper.",
    "Her net worth peaked at $12 billion in 2018, but Kingston's market value has fallen sharply since then as the firm's profits have tumbled."
