  "about": [
    "In the early days of Home Depot no one came into the store, so Marcus and Blank sent their kids out into the streets to hand $1 bills to anyone willing to walk in.",
    "Initially, Marcus wanted to be a doctor but couldn't afford Harvard Medical School, so he instead studied pharmaceuticals at Rutgers in his native N.J."
