    "Alan Howard runs Brevan Howard Asset Management, a European hedge fund specializing in macro trading that he cofounded in 2002.",
    "The firm was once one of the world's top macro hedge funds, with assets under management peaking at $40 billion in 2013.",
    "A recent streak of uninspiring returns has led to billions in withdrawals by investors, and the firm's assets have dwindled to under $10 billion.",
    "Howard's main fund has posted negative returns in three of the past four years, dropping 5% in 2017."
