    "Alan Howard cofounded Brevan Howard Asset Management, a European hedge fund specializing in macro trading, in 2002.",
    "The firm was once one of the world's top macro hedge funds, with assets under management peaking at $40 billion in 2013.",
    "A streak of uninspiring returns led to billions in investor withdrawals, but assets have rebounded to $36 billion after solid returns in recent years.",
    "In October 2019, Howard stepped down as CEO to focus solely on investing and to give portfolio managers more autonomy."
