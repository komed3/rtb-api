  "about": [
    "Blundy's interest in business started early. He grew up on a small farm near Melbourne where he and his four siblings would pick mushrooms to sell from a roadside stall for five cents a pound.",
    "His career dream was to be a pilot, but that was thwarted when he failed the final year of school.",
    "At age 20, Blundy bought a run-down record store in a suburb called Packenham with a friend. The business failed, and they had to take on day jobs to support it."
