    "Kim Kardashian has parlayed reality TV stardom into a ten-figure fortune, the vast majority of which comes from her stake in Skims, her shapewear business.",
    "Skims is worth $5 billion after a 2025 funding round. The company's investors include billionaires Stephen Mandel, Daniel Sundheim and Josh Kushner, who is Ivanka Trump's brother-in-law.",
    "Skims began as an online, direct-to-consumer brand, but has grown to 20 stores in the U.S. and Mexico with plans to become a mainly brick-and-mortar business in the coming years.",
    "Kardashian sold 20% of her KKW Beauty to French beauty giant Coty in 2021, but later shut down the business and launched SKKN By Kim. Coty divested its stake to Skims in March 2025.",
    "Kardashian divorced musician Kanye West in 2022. They share custody of their four children, and Kardashian reportedly paid $23 million to keep their Axel Vervoordt-designed Hidden Hills mansion."
