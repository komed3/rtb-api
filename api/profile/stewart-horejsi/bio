  "bio": [
    "Stewart Horejsi began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway for as little as $265 per share after reading John Train's \"The Money Masters\" in 1980.",
    "He attended annual meetings when they were fewer than a dozen people in folding chairs; now Berkshire's class A stock is the world's most valuable.",
    "Horejsi (pronounced hor-ish) still owns some Berkshire shares, but has also put hundreds of millions of dollars into his own closed-end mutual fund.",
    "After graduating from the University of Kansas in 1962, Horejsi returned home to Salina, Kansas to take over his family's welding supply company.",
    "He expanded the business, investing profits in Berkshire Hathaway stock, and has spent much of his life managing his family's money."
