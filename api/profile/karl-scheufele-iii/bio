    "Owners of Swiss jewelry and watchmaker Chopard, Karl Scheufele III. and his family control one of the best-known luxury accessory lines in the world.",
    "A goldsmith and watchmaker by training, German-born Scheufele bought the Geneva-based company in 1963, before transforming it into a global brand.",
    "Even after over 50 years, Scheufele remains active in the company. But nowadays it is his children, Karl-Heinz and Caroline, who lead the business.",
    "Chopard's jewelry is a regular on the red carpet, with eleven Academy Award nominees having won while wearing Chopard, most recently Julianne Moore.",
    "Scheufele invests his money in gold. But he does not want other investors to follow suit, as the higher prices actually increase Chopard's costs."
