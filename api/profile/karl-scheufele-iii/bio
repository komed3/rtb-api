  "Owners of Swiss jewelry and watchmaker Chopard, Karl Scheufele III and his family control one of the best-known luxury accessory lines in the world.",
  "A goldsmith and watchmaker by training, the German-born Scheufele bought the Geneva-based company in 1963, before transforming it into a global brand.",
  "50 years later Scheufele remains active in the company, though his children Karl-Friedrich and Caroline lead the business.",
  "Chopard's jewelry is a regular on the red carpet, with 11 Oscar winners having won while wearing Chopard, including Kate Winslet and Julianne Moore.",
  "Scheufele invests his money in gold. But he does not want other investors to follow suit, as the higher prices actually increase Chopard's costs. "
