    "Tiger Woods has earned roughly $1.8 billion pretax in his pro golf career, including a PGA Tour-record $121 million in prize money. In 2022, Forbes certified him as a billionaire, making him only the second active athlete ever with that distinction, after LeBron James.",
    "Woods reached that rarified air despite reportedly turning down a \"mind-blowingly enormous\" offer from the upstart LIV Golf tour, a deal that LIV CEO Greg Norman told the Washington Post would have been in the \"high nine digits.\"",
    "Woods has parlayed his golfing paychecks into investments that include two homes on Jupiter Island, a golf-course design business and high-end mini-golf chain Popstroke.",
    "Woods and fellow golf star Rory McIlroy announced in 2022 that they had founded TMRW Sports, a tech-focused venture that launched a new golf league called TGL in 2025.",
    "The superstar is also a partner with Justin Timberlake and British billionaire Joe Lewis in Nexxus, a luxury real-estate venture."
