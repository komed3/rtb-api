    "Yang Huiyan chairs property developer Country Garden. She became the only one at the helm after her father Yeung Kwok Keung stepped down as co-chair in February 2023.",
    "Yang has long been groomed for succession. Yeung transferred a 57% Country Garden stake to her back in 2007, which once made her the world's youngest female billionaire.",
    "Her sister Yang Ziying also sits on the board; husband Chen Chong is a non-executive director.",
    "In August 2023, Country Garden triggered fresh turmoil in China's beleaguered real estate market after it missed interest payments of $22.5 million on two offshore bonds.",
    "Yang donated in the same year $826 million worth of shares in property management arm Country Garden Services to a Hong Kong charity set up by sister Ziying."
