    "Thomas Bradbury is the founder and executive chairman of homebuilder Smith Douglas Homes.",
    "Bradbury sold his first house to a police officer and a municipal clerical worker for $35,000 in 1975.",
    "That was the start of Colony Homes, which built entry-level residences in Georgia and North Carolina before Bradbury sold it to KB Home for $67 million.",
    "Five years later, when KB Home pulled out of Atlanta, Bradbury, frustrated they'd abandoned the market, started Smith Douglas Homes.",
    "Since then, he's built 15,000 homes, mainly for lower-to-middle class buyers in cities such as Nashville, Charlotte and Raleigh. Bradbury took Smith Douglas public in 2024."
