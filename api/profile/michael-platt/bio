    "Michael Platt is the cofounder and CEO of BlueCrest Capital Management, which he started in late 2000 after nearly a decade at JP Morgan.",
    "Platt built BlueCrest into one of the world's largest hedge fund firms; at its peak, it managed more than $35 billion in assets.",
    "A push into equities and poor results led to investor exits and he returned outside investors' money in 2015, remaking BlueCrest into a family office.",
    "The firm has flourished since then, generating a 95% net return in 2020 after returns in the 50% range in 2016, 2017 and 2019."
