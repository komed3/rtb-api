    "Cameron's big break came with 1984's 'The Terminator,' a script he sold for $1 with the promise that he'd be allowed to direct.",
    "At the 1998 Academy Awards, Cameron won Best Director, Best Editing and Best Picture for 'Titanic,' quoting his own movie from the stage: \"I'm the king of the world!\"",
    "On the production of 'Avatar,' Cameron developed--often at his own expense--new film technology such as a 3D camera system, head rigs for facial capture technology and a simulcam system that allowed him to see his actors rendered in digital environments in real time.",
    "When 'Avatar' earned nearly $3 billion at the box office, and millions more in DVD sales and streaming, Cameron earned an estimated $350 million before taxes and fees.",
    "Cameron is also a renowned deep sea adventurer, making several dives to the real life Titanic crash site and becoming the first solo expeditioner to travel to the lowest point of the Mariana Trench."
