    "Evan Wallace is cofounder and former chief technology officer of design software company Figma, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in July 2025.",
    "Figma listed its shares at a fully diluted valuation (including outstanding equity awards) of nearly $20 billion. Its stock price more than tripled on its first trading day.",
    "Figma had previously agreed to be acquired by Adobe for $20 billion in September 2022, but the deal was scrapped in December 2023 over regulatory concerns.",
    "Wallace launched Figma in 2012 with Brown University classmate Dylan Field. Wallace left the company in 2021 but remains the company's second largest individual shareholder after Field.",
    "Wallace donated a third of his Figma stock to the nonprofit Marin Community Foundation a month before Figma went public. The gift was worth nearly $440 million based on Figma's IPO listing price."
