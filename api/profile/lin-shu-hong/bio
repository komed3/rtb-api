    "Lin chaired Chang Chun Group--one of Asia's largest petrochemical companies, with plants in Taiwan, China and Southeast Asia--until the end of 2013.",
    "He cofounded the business in 1949 with classmates Tseng Shin-yi and M.K. Liao, with only $100. He's the only surviving member of the trio.",
    "The name \"Chang Chun\" in Chinese loosely means \"long spring,\" and reflects the wish among the three that their bonds would endure."
