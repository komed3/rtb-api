  "Bill Stone started financial-software firm SS&C Technologies in 1986 with the $20,000 he had saved from his days as a KPMG executive.",
  "His product became popular among asset managers, bankers and insurers who wanted to electronically manage their books.",
  "He guided the firm to an IPO in 1996, but the dot-com crash nearly crippled the company in 2001.",
  "Stone refocused and added services such as data centers, then took the company private in 2005.",
  "In 2011, a resurgent SS&amp;C went public again; Stone remains the firm's largest individual shareholder, with a 13% stake."
