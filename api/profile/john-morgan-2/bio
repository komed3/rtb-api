    "John Morgan founded and runs America's largest personal injury law firm, Morgan & Morgan.",
    "Morgan launched the firm in 1988, after his younger brother Tim, who died in July 2024 at age 65, was paralyzed in a diving accident as a teenage lifeguard at a Disney resort.",
    "Morgan and his family own about half of the $2 billion (2023 revenue) law firm, with around 139 equity partners owning the rest.",
    "His wife and sons are lawyers and work at the family firm, which spends $350 million annually on billboard, cable and other ads, some featuring Morgan as everything from a UFC fighter to Santa.",
    "Morgan has been a major Democratic donor since the 1980s and has often teased a run for Florida governor. He registered as an independent in 2017."
