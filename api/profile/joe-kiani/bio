    "Joe Kiani founded and runs medical technology firm Masimo Corp., whose devices non-invasively measure oxygen levels in patients' blood.",
    "Kiani, an immigrant from Iran who studied electrical engineering in the U.S., came up with a way to vastly improve the performance of pulse oximeters.",
    "Following years of struggle to break into the U.S. hospital market, Masimo became the leader in pulse oximetry for hospitals.",
    "In February 2022, Kiani led Masimo to purchase Sound United, owner of speaker and headphone brands Marantz, Denon, Bowers & Wilkins and more, for about $1 billion.",
    "Investors panned the move, wiping away $5 billion of market capitalization; Kiani is betting that his devices can help with monitoring health at home."
