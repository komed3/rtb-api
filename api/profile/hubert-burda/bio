  "Known for his glamorous lifestyle, Hubert Burda inherited and ran his family's media company for over 20 years before handing over the reins in 2010.",
  "He has transferred Burda Media shares to his two children, Elisabeth and Jacob (each now hold 37.4% of the company).",
  "However, because \"rights of usufruct\" entitle Hubert to receive economic benefits from those shares, Forbes attributes 100% ownership to him.",
  "Burda Media's portfolio consists of 600 media products in 20 countries, including Focus and Bunte and the German editions of Cosmopolitan and Playboy.",
  "The company has capitalized on its iconic brands by moving them to the digital space, which accounts for about half of its revenue."
