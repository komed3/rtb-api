    "Known for his glamorous lifestyle, Hubert Burda inherited and ran his family's media company for over 20 years before handing over management of the company to Paul-Bernhard Kallen in 2010.",
    "He has transferred Burda Media shares to his two children, Elisabeth and Jacob (each now hold 37.4% of the company).",
    "However, because \"rights of usufruct\" entitle Hubert to receive economic benefits from those shares, Forbes attributes the ownership to him.",
    "Burda Media's portfolio consists of 500 media products in 14 countries, including Focus and Bunte and the German editions of Harper's Bazaar, ELLE and InStyle.",
    "While continuing to invest in its magazine business, the group has built up its digital business, which now accounts for well over half of sales."
