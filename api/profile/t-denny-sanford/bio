  "T. Denny Sanford owns First Premier Bank, which specializes in offering credit cards to high-risk borrowers.",
  "The Sioux Falls, South Dakota, bank has just 17 branches, but is one of the largest issuers of Mastercards - many with steep rates and low limits.",
  "An active philanthropist, Sanford says he wants to die broke. But he faces a rare problem: He says he can't get rid of his fortune fast enough.",
  "Thanks to hefty dividends from First Premier, Sanford is no closer to bankruptcy than when he began, despite giving more than $1.6 billion to charity."
