  "bio": [
    "Rolf Gerling inherited insurer Gerling Konzern, showed little interest in managing it and saw the legacy plunge into turmoil.",

    "Mismanagement, losses from the September 11 attacks and costly asbestos claims led Rolf to sell the company for an estimated $1 billion in 2005.",
    "A passionate environmentalist, he leads a withdrawn life in Switzerland.",
    "His portfolio includes real estate through companies like DufourIm AG, which is headed by long-time Gerling confidant Heino von Have."
