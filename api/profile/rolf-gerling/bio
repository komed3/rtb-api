  "Rolf Gerling inherited insurer Gerling Konzern, showed little interest in managing it and saw the legacy plunge into turmoil.",
  "His grandfather Robert founded the business in 1904 and his father, Hans, expanded it into a global insurance group. Hans died in 1992.",
  "Mismanagement, losses from the September 11 attacks and costly asbestos claims led Rolf to sell the company for an estimated $1 billion in 2005.",
  "His portfolio includes real estate through companies like DufourIm AG, which is headed by long-time Gerling confidant Heino von Have.",
  "A passionate environmentalist, Gerling leads a withdrawn life in Switzerland."
