    "Instead Graf began importing American pinball machines to Austria via Belgium, then became an agent for a British slot machine company.",
    "In 1980 he stuck out on his own with Novomatic, which he quickly expanded into Switzerland and then the East Bloc after the fall of the Iron Curtain.",
