  "Luciano Benetton started the Benetton Group in 1965 with his three siblings, Carlo (d.2018), Gilberto (d.2018) and Giuliana.",
  "Known for their colorful sweaters, Benetton won over parts of the world, opening its first store in Paris in 1969 and reaching New York in 1980.",
  "The brand hit some turbulence at the turn of the century amid falling demand for its sweaters and has continued to struggle in recent years.",
  "In 2018, 12 years after leaving and allowing outside managers to take on greater roles, Luciano returned to help revive the ailing company.",
  "The family has invested in Italian businesses including Atlantia, a highway infrastructure company that accounts for more than half their fortune."
