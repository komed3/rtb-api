    "Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson is one of the greatest NBA players of all time. Forbes named him a billionaire in October 2023.",
    "Johnson earned only around $40 million total as a Los Angeles Lakers player, mainly in the 1980s, and even at his peak only brought in between $2 million and $4 million per year in endorsements.",
    "Instead he built his wealth through joint venture partnerships in everything from movie theaters, Starbucks franchises, real estate and healthcare.",
    "The majority of his fortune comes from a 60% ownership stake in life insurance company Equitrust, which has grown from $16 billion in assets under management to $26 billion since he took over in 2015.",
    "He also owns small ownership stakes in the NFL's Washington Commanders, MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks and MLS' LAFC."
