  "Aloys Wobben's Enercon, with around $5 billion in annual revenue, is one of the world's largest producers of wind turbines.",
  "Founded by Wobben in 1984, it focuses on on-shore wind parks and is not active in the U.S. It's the second-biggest player in Europe behind Vestas.",
  "The company's big technological breakthrough came in 1992 with the launch of the first gear-less wind turbine.",
  "In contrast  to some of its competitors, Enercon not only produces and sets up wind turbines but also offers service programs for its plants.",
  "For health reasons, Wobben stepped back from active business life in 2012."
