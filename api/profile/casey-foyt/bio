    "Foyt is the granddaughter of Robert Irsay, who acquired the Indianapolis Colts in 1972, and the middle daughter of Jim Irsay, who ran the team from 1997 until his death in May 2025.",
    "She and her sisters, Carlie Irsay-Gordon and Kalen Jackson, inherited what Forbes estimates are equal 33.3% stakes in the franchise. They now rank among the richest female owners in sports.",
    "Long before the three sisters were publicly named Colts co-owners in 2012, their lives revolved around the NFL schedule. At an introductory press conference in June 2025, Foyt recalled answering the phones at the front desk while she was in high school.",
    "Early in her career, Foyt worked for the NFL, where she helped plan the league's first regular-season game played outside North America, in London in 2007.",
    "She returned to the Colts that year with a focus on marketing and community relationships."
